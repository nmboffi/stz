TO GET PARALLELISM WITH MPI WORKING:
[DONE]- rewrite plane & line exchanges as single communication
- figure out printing (either one proc gathers, or coordinate all procs printing)
[DONE]- convert to C versions of all MPI functions in sim.pyx
[DONE]- create MPI datatype for Field?
[DONE]- figure out why Cython can't find mpi4py pxd files
- make sure dividing up grid between procs correctly
[DONE]- figure out dimensions as function of size (restrict size to a power of 2?)

OPTIMIZATION:
- Python threading or prange within subdomains
- AVX

IF TIME:
- add in neglected advective terms

Current Goals:
- Determine processor locations in the grid
- Fix printing so that it accurately reflects processor location
- Determine if the boundary conditions are being set properly
- Once boundary conditions are set properly, set boundary conditions on the whole grid, print them,
run ghost code, and print them again - boundary conditions should not change
